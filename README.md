# Every Vote
This is a website for showing people all of the different voting methods that there are, and letting them make their own ballots and poll their friends on different things. It could be on where you want to go for lunch, or something else.
There are no logins, and currently all data is shared, so please don't put anything on here you don't want people seeing.

The test version is available at https://every-vote-76957.herokuapp.com/

I used this project to teach myself Ruby and Rails, so it is not especially optimized.
